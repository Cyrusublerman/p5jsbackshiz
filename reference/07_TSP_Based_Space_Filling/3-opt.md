# 3-opt

In optimization, 3-opt is a simple local search heuristic for finding approximate solutions to the travelling salesperson problem and related network optimization problems. Compared to the simpler 2-opt algorithm, it is slower but can generate higher-quality solutions.

3-opt analysis involves deleting three edges from the current solution to the problem, creating three sub-tours. There are eight ways of connecting these sub-tours back into a single tour, one of which consists of the three deleted edges. These reconnections are analysed to find the optimum one. This process is then repeated for a different set of 3 connections, until all possible combinations have been tried in a network. A single pass through all triples of edges has a time complexity of $O(n^{3})$. Iterated 3-opt, in which passes are repeated until no more improvements can be found, has a higher time complexity.

In an array representation of a tour with $k$ nodes $S=[n_{0},n_{1},n_{2},...,n_{k-1},n_{k}]$, where $n_{0}=n_{k}$, deleting three edges separates $S$ into four segments $S_{1}$, $S_{2}$, $S_{3}$ and $S_{4}$. Note that the segments $S_{1}$ and $S_{4}$ are connected. The reconnection of the Subtours is done by a combination of reversing one or both of $S_{2}$ and $S_{3}$ and switching their respective positions. The 8 possible new tours are $[S_{1},S_{2},S_{3},S_{4}]$, $[S_{1},{\overleftrightarrow {S_{2}}},S_{3},S_{4}]$, $[S_{1},S_{2},{\overleftrightarrow {S_{3}}},S_{4}]$,
$$[S_{1},{\overleftrightarrow {S_{2}}},{\overleftrightarrow {S_{3}}},S_{4}]
$$, $[S_{1},S_{3},S_{2},S_{4}]$, $[S_{1},{\overleftrightarrow {S_{3}}},S_{2},S_{4}]$, $[S_{1},S_{3},{\overleftrightarrow {S_{2}}},S_{4}]$ and
$$[S_{1},{\overleftrightarrow {S_{3}}},{\overleftrightarrow {S_{2}}},S_{4}]
$$. Here ${\overleftrightarrow {S_{i}}}$ indicates that segment $i$ is reversed.
